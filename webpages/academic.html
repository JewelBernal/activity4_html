          United Montessorean School, where I studied from Pre-school to Grade 4. The campus is located in San Pedro,
          Laguna, near the boundary to Muntinlupa. This is where my education began, I could say that the academic track
          here was a little "outdated" compared to the other schools I attended. We were only studying multiplication
          during Grade
          4 whereas we should already be studying factors already, but welp.

          Jesus the Risen Savior School, a De La Salle Accredited School. I transferred here from UMS, and studied from
          Grade 5 to Grade 9. When I first transferred here, I've had a hard time catching up to advanced lessons as I
          wasn't taught lessons like here compared to when I was studying in UMS. Here I first joined Volleyball Varsity
          Team. I learned a lot here, in terms of life lessons, and academic.

          Southernside Montessori School, the campus is located in Muntinlupa. I transferred here after 9th Grade in
          JRSS. Tuition Fee here is significantly lower compared to JRSS, academic track is the same to JRSS so it was a
          win. I studied Grade 10 and finished Senior Highschool here. Met a lot of friends here and I continued and
          ended my Volleyball Varsity career here until graduation. I'll always remember my
          time here.

          National University Manila, I started college here. I took the course Bachelor of Science in Information
          Technology -
          Mobile and Web Applications. My whole time enrolled here was spent on online classes because of the pandemic,
          so I can't say I enjoyed my time here, nevertheless, professors and education here are okay.

          iACADEMY, campus located in Makati. I didn't finish my course BSIT and shifted to Software Engineering and
          transferred here since Software Engineering was actually my first choice and was on the fence between choices
          and have to make a decision fast. Here, I haven't even finished yet, but I am really enjoying my time here. I
          am learning a lot, in a fun way, and in a challenging way, which I enjoy. Made few friends along too.
